## My Work at Coolbeans Digital

During my time at **Coolbeans Digital**, I had the chance to work on diverse and exciting projects, where I specialized in **Flutter development** and contributed to creating user-friendly, high-performance mobile applications. I took on several roles within the team and had the opportunity to apply my skills in **clean architecture**, **state management** using **Bloc**, and **data fetching** with **Retrofit**.

I worked on two major projects:

1. **Goody**: An **e-commerce app** for selling skincare products, where I integrated a backend API and ensured the app provided a seamless user experience. The app's design and functionality were highly polished, and I optimized the performance to make sure it was responsive and user-friendly.
2. **Jelly**: A **cinema ticket booking app** that allowed users to book tickets from multiple providers, as well as event tickets. I integrated **Firebase for notifications** and **Firebase App Distribution** for beta testing, while also implementing **CI/CD pipelines** using **Codemagic** for smooth deployment across platforms.

I worked on building these apps from the ground up, collaborating with a team of developers and designers to ensure we met the needs of the users while maintaining clean and maintainable code. The experience of shipping high-quality apps on schedule, while adhering to best practices and optimizing for performance, helped solidify my confidence as a **Flutter developer**.

The work environment at Coolbeans Digital was incredibly collaborative, and I enjoyed learning from experienced developers while contributing my expertise to deliver successful projects. It was a rewarding experience where I was able to grow my technical skills and expand my knowledge in mobile app development.
