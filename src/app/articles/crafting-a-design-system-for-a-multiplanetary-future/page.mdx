## School Projects

Throughout my time at SETEC Institute, I have built numerous projects that helped me develop a diverse skill set in both web app development.

- **FoodFarm**: Built an online platform called **FoodFarm** using **vanilla PHP**. The application served as a marketplace for farm products, allowing users to buy and sell items while gaining hands-on experience with PHP, databases, and backend development. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Joselay/FoodFarm)
- **Jelly**: Developed a **SaaS task management app** named **Jelly**, using **InertiaJS** with **VueJS** and **Laravel**. This project involved building an intuitive platform for managing tasks and projects with real-time updates and a seamless user experience. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Joselay/jelly-saas)
- **NextStore**: Created **NextStore**, a full-stack e-commerce web application built on **Next.js**. The project included the main **NextStore** app and an **admin panel**, allowing for the management of products, users, and orders. I utilized **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, and **API integration** to ensure fast, SEO-optimized performance. [NextStore](https://github.com/Joselay/nextstore) | [NextStore Admin](https://github.com/Joselay/nextstore-admin)
- **NextStore Documentation**: Developed **NextStore Documentation** using **Next.js** to showcase how to install and use the **NextStore** application. This project helped me understand the importance of clear and concise documentation for supporting users and developers alike. [Link](https://nextstore-docs.vercel.app/)

These projects not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the value of collaboration, problem-solving, and creating scalable, user-focused applications.
